1. Progress of the week:
   - Decided the topic to be "AI playing Connect using minimax algorithm for calculation and alpha-beta pruning for optimization"
   - 3 hours of research in total for start of the project including online research and reading the course outline.
   - Initial commit & repository cloned into local device
   - Labtool registration complete
   - Project management tools installed & tested
   - Created scpecification document

2. The programming has not yet started.

3. During this week I've learnt how minimax algorithm works, what alpha beta pruning is, what are heuristic values, what is poetry for python & how to set it up.

4. I don't fully understand the alpha beta pruning yet. The course outline is so chaotic that I'm very worried that my submissions miss something important.

5. Next steps are making a Connect 4 game with all the functions like "status_check" to check if game has ended, "possible_moves" that generates all the possible moves in a position, "make_move" to make a move". After this I can start making the AI to play the game.

AI usage: This week I have used AI on studying the algorithms and how they work and helping me with git pull problems because I built the poetry without pulling the previous changes.
