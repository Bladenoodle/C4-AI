Total of 15+ hours of work this week.

1 & 3. This week I fully learnt how to make my minimax algorithm, heuristic function, and alpha beta pruning. I carefully checked the course requirements for a good minimax AI and planned the full outline of my program. Furthermore, I learnt about set copying, infinite floats, and how to make more accurate heuristic functions.

2. The terminal interface of the game is polished for better user experience. Minimax algorithm with pruning can now play in depth 7 without significant delay. Very proud of it surviving 14 moves as player 2 against a Connect 4 solver that theoretically will win in 20 moves. 

While writing this i found out that testing has to be done this week, so I went to test it with different situations. I found out that there are certain positions where it cant even find win in 2, so I will have to work on that next week.

4 & 5. Uncertainties that bother me this week is how to further optimize the efficiency of my program. My program now has many functions that rebuilt same sets ps, ps1 and ps2. Thus, I'm thinking about initializing class parameters that hold the latest moves (as suggested in the course instructions), the empty cells, player 1's pieces and plyer 2's pieces. 

AI usage:
As always I have used LLM to help debugging, but it also helped me a lot in print_board function.
