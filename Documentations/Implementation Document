Program structure:
Connect_4.py contains the basic functions for a connect four game, a heuristic function and different kinds of win and draw checking, preparing for a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

Time compexity:
Time complexity is around O(b^(d/2)), where b is the average number of available moves and d is the chosen depth of calculation. The b is practically 7 most of the time, making the time compexity approximately O(7^(d/2)).

Space complexity is O(d)

Performance and compexity comparison:
The performance of minimax without pruning could run with depth = 6. After pruning it could run with depth = 7. After all the optimization in heuristic function and optimizing recursion pattern, it can now run with depth 10.

Possible improvements:
- Heuristic function optization
- Move ordering
- Interative deepening

AI usage:
The help of LLM has only been used in debugging, information gathering, helping with pylint and github operations, and as a "rubber duck" (see rubber duck debugging).
