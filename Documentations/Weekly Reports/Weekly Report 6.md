Total of 10+ hours of work this week.

1 & 3. This week I created invoke testing methods polished the code and the documentation preparing for the peer review in the upcoming week. I learned how to install invoke to poetry, more about how poetry works, how to make testing filees and how to optimally organize files.

2. The heuristic function improvements I planned for this week went south due to the requirements with documentation. The main progress of this week is that I've made a fully functional testing code for users to test with an excellent coverage.

4 & 5. I am not certain about are my documentations now up to standards to get a high grade on the course. I hope that teacher will elaborate more on my works grading and what I have to take a closer look at in the last week of developing this program.

AI usage:
As always I have used LLM to help debugging, information gathering, and formalizing my program.
