Total of 10+ hours of work this week.

1 & 3. This week I learnt that using class to handle connect four and sets to hold the information is inefficient. Thus, I remade the connect_4.py to be more efficient. The bug where minimax cannot find the shortest way to win is fixed by adjusting winning evaluation from infinites to a fixed number 100000 that increases or decreases by depth.

2. The main.py now hold the main program, where user can choose to play against the bot or setup a board for minimax algorithm to play against itself with user's choice of depth. The performance against an theoretically perfect connect 4 solver was tested 10 times per side and my minimax lost the majority of them in 18 moves, but to my surprise, it won 1 game as player 1!

4 & 5. I know that next up I have to do iterative deepening, but have little idea how would it make minimax performance go a step higher, nevertheless, I will optimize my minimax with it.

AI usage:
As always I have used LLM to help debugging, but it also helped me in formalizing my program and commit management.
