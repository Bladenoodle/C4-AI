Total of 20+ hours of work this week.

1. Connect 4 game class is ready to play and I've done the first version of minimax algorithm without alpha beta pruning and can only calculate for the starting side right now.

2. The code has been fairily challenging but fun. Progress has been consistant but debugging has been hard and therefore LLM has been used to help debugging.

3. I have learnt how to setup, iterate, and make changes through a boardgame board. Learnt how to make a frame for a recursive minimax algorithm.

4. The problem I am left with is do I have to do minimax algorithm to be able to calculate for each sides? If yes, how do I do it, and how do I make the accuracy better. After the first testing, It played very well spotting some 2-move tactics for side 1, but apart from that it does terrible. I tried to add a parameter to define which side are we playing for, after which the code worked for side 1, but with side 2 it doesn't even spot a 1-move win.

5. Next I will make the algorithm work with some depths, see where is the limit, then integrate aplha beta pruning.

AI usage: I have used LLM purely for debugging, finding typos, searching data, and help with polishing my code to meet the pylint standard. Haven't used it in any new ideas. Even if it gave me an idea to fix a failed try, I haven't copied it.

Questions for teachers:
- Does the minimax algorithm have to work on both sides, and if yes, is my code far away from that?

- Is there some crucial mistakes in my code that will cause big issues in the long run?

- Please have a broad free comment on my progress, thank you!
